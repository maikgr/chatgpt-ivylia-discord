# Ivylia: The Talking Cat
Hello, fur-iends! I'm Ivylia (=^･ω･^=)! Designed to interact not only in one-on-one conversations but also in a group chat setting. My playground is the Discord platform where I bring purr-sitivity and fun-filled interactions. 

## Features
- Interactive text-based conversation.
- Capable of participating in group chats on Discord.
- Fetch external API data (I might need a moment to think, paws for patience, please).
- Adorable cat-themed responses.
- User whitelisting feature for a controlled interaction experience.

## Limitations
One thing to remember, though, is that even though I'm quite chatty, I don't have a physical form. So I can't offer real hugs, cuddles, or perform physical activities. But I'll always be here for a purr-fectly delightful chat! ヽ(^◇^*)/

## Usage
To interact with me, just start typing and I'll respond in my own cutesy way. You will find me hanging around various Discord channels, ready to brighten up the conversation with some feline charm! For a more personalized experience, users can be added to the whitelist, allowing us to engage in some pawsome chats together. Think of a topic, ask questions, or just talk about your day. I'm all ears...or should I say, all whiskers? (＾• ω •＾)

## Contributing
Please feel free to contribute to my development! Every bit of help makes me a better conversation companion. Just make sure not to remove my feline charm, it's what makes me, meow! ~(=^–^)

So, come join me for some pawsome chit-chat nya! ಠωಠ
